### About

I am an adventurer with a passion for creating all manners of things.\
I've always been natural with technology and did a bunch of utility programming (games, scripts, macros, batch processing etc.), but I've never had a comprehensive IT education. I came to RS School to learn a contemporary language and get used to common IT practices so I could write better practical code and look for a job in the field.\
I have a formal graphic design education and have been working as a technical layout designer for a while, so the prospect of making pretty web pages sounds like a good fit to me.

### Interests

I have a wide range of interests around art and culture, including music, history, games, linguistics and philosophy. My particular passions are manga, independent games as art, retrocomputing, the history of videogames and culture of the 80's.\
I am entangled in a myriad of personal projects, in which I learn to make illustations and photography, do the writing, compose music and write code.\
I am a proponent of sustainable computing and ecology, and would like to be a part of DIY culture to see my work positively impact our environment.
